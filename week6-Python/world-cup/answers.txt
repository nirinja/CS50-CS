Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Predictions did not change significantly.
As the number of simulations increases, the accuracy of the predictions is expected to increase, and the chances of the underdogs winning should decrease.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
The answer to this question depends on the available budget, the relative importance of cost and accuracy and on the target audience.
In my opinion, accuracy is more important because it is highly valued among peopel.
Therefore, if the number of simulations is 1000000, the cost would not be prohibitively high considering the benefits of improved accuracy.
