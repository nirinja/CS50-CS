If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
By the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A better way of calculating the audio aura would be by getting information about the listener's musical preferences and experiences.
This could include asking the listener for more detailed feedback on their top songs and artists, as well as analyzing their playlist data.
By doing so, the audio aura would be more personalized, accurate, and meaningful for the listener.
