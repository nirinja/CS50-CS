    int scores[1024];

}
Notice that running this code will allocate 1024 locations in memory for your array, but the for loop will likely show that not all values therein are 0.
Itâ€™s always best practice to be aware of the potential for garbage values when you do not initialize blocks of memory to some other value like zero or otherwise.
