There are many algorithms for sorting arrays of numbers in C.
In general, Merge Sort and Quick Sort are considered to be more efficient than Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort, especially for larger arrays.
However, if the array is small, simple sorting algorithms such as Bubble, Selection, or Insertion Sort may be more efficient.
The best algorithm depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your situation. Here are some commonly used sorting algorithms in C:

1. Bubble Sort: It's a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
 It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

2. Selection Sort: It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
 It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

3.Insertion Sort: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each item in its proper place in the sorted array.
 It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

4.Merge Sort: It's a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.
 It has a time complexity of O(n log n).

5. Quick Sort: It's also a divide and conquer algorithm that picks an element as pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
 It has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case, but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case.

5. Heap Sort: It sorts the array by building a binary heap from the array and repeatedly extracting the maximum element from it. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).
